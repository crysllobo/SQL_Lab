# SQL Lab Supply Chain
SQL Labs is a comprehensive engagement module that will test your understanding of basic as well as advanced SQL concepts via a combination of timed tests and well-researched assignments.

The following steps summarise the manner in which you should process your thinking and visualization while writing the solution query:
- Visualising the required output
- Which columns will be there?
- Which rows will be selected? Defined by the usage of filters (WHERE and HAVING)
- What would be the granularity of the data? Defined by aggregations (GROUP BY)
- Using CTEs or subqueries for better organization of the query
- Validating individual sections by running them independently and validating the results
- Combining or stitching the smaller pieces together, to obtain the entire solution
- Checking for rows explosion while performing JOINs
